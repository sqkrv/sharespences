FTS's (Federal Tax Service) official service with electronic checks for individuals. It's based on the requirement for merchants to store and share (with user's consent) items acquired within this purchase. User can scan a QR code on a fiscal check and view all items belonging to this receipt.
Basically this service (integration) will be used to get a list of positions for a specific expense. For example after group trip to a restaurant you scan a fiscal receipt to get ordered dishes and their amount, then assign each dish to each member of the group.
