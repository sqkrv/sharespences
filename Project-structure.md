### Budgeting
Base of the app. Add expenses and incomes from various sources, view expenses history, keep track of balances across all banks and wallets.

### Group expenses
Philosophy of the app. Pay solo for your group, divide expenses after. Indicate your expense as a group one, assign parts of it to your companions manually or by receipt's positions. They will immediately know how much and why they owe you. In a trip? Enjoy it, leave accounting to us, just don't forget to quickly assign participators in the moment. 

### Cashbacks
All cashbacks in one place. No more remembering what cashbacks you've assigned and what credit card to get the most of the purchase. Keep all cashbacks for this month across all banks in one app. Avoid unnecessary collisions and find out the best choices for each bank provided the options.

### MCC
Most useful implementation of MCCs base. Find out the real MCC of the merchant, provided by your fellow users. This corner shop is technically a flower shop. Now your cashback is not that useless!

### Subscriptions
God, I love capitalism. Expect unexpected recurring expenses. Split the cost with your friends. ~~Hurt big conglomerates where they expect it less.~~ Keep track of deadbeats and kick them out.

### Analytics
Everyone loves fancy graphs, right? See how much you've spent on taxis comparing to groceries at a glance. Where you've made all of your purchases, zenly-inspired map of expenses, how your expense habits changed over the years.
