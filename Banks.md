This page contains a list of the main banks that are being considered in this project.

Since this project is targeted at CIS countries' citizens, primarily Russians, all the banks listed are based in Russia. Most of these banks also operate in other CIS countries, but their operations may differ in those regions.

## [Alfa-Bank (Альфа-Банк)](https://alfabank.ru/)

This is my main bank, so most of the features and modules are developed and tested using this bank.

## [VTB (ВТБ)](https://www.vtb.ru/)

This is my second or third most used bank because of their additional cashback categories, which are given if your account has a specified amount of money. A similar system also exists in Yandex Pay.

## [Ozon Bank (Озон Банк)](https://finance.ozon.ru/)

I'm using Ozon Bank from time to time, and it is quite a simple bank, so it has a high priority in implementation.

## [Yandex Pay (Яндекс Пэй)](https://bank.yandex.ru/pay/)

I don't use it much, but it has unique functionality such as a fortune wheel that gives you cashback for a couple of days every 10 days. It also uses its own loyalty system — [Plus Points](https://yandex.ru/support/plus-ru/ru/cashback), which should also be considered in the project.

## [Gazprombank (Газпромбанк)](https://www.gazprombank.ru/)

Gazprombank is one of the largest banks in Russia, serving both corporate and individual clients. 

## [MKB (МКБ)](https://mkb.ru/)

Their cashback system is also quite unique. They have their own loyalty points, and cashback is picked for a quarter instead of 1 month like in other banks.

## [Sberbank (Сбербанк)](https://www.sberbank.ru/ru/person)

Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia. Personally, I don't use this bank at all, so it's at the end of the compatibility list.

## ~~Tinkoff Bank (Тинькофф Банк)~~ [T-Bank (Т-Банк)](https://www.tbank.ru/)

Probably the largest [neobank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neobank) in Russia. This bank is at the end of the list along with Sberbank, but at least I have an account in the latter.
